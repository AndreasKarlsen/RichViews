RichViews
=========

An example of using RichViews instead of Fragments in Android. Inspired by the [blog series](http://www.briangriffey.com/#/blog "Brian Griffeys blog") of Brian Griffey (@briangriffey).

My intention for this repository, is to display the rich view concept. I highly encourage everybody with an oppinion about it to fork, pull request, star, or in any other way give feedback for improvements.
